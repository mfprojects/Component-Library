# Creating reusable components for React. 
### The components are designed to be with minimal default data but rather utilizing TypeScripts utilities like interface to be robust and easy to understand. 
Based on [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components using Tailwind CSS and Typescript.
### Developed with minimal external libraries, but all dependencies will be listed for each component when they are done.
